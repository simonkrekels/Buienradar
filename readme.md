# Buienradar
A simple script to retrieve buienradar information from the Belgian [KMI/IRM](https://www.meteo.be/en/brussels "Website"). 

The script will retrieve buienradar images of the last 90 minutes and display them in an animation. This script only works for Belgian forecasting.

The default language of the pulled images can be set manually within the script. Other languages can be set using the `-l` option. Supported languages are
- Dutch `nl`
- French `fr`
- German `de`
- English `en`
