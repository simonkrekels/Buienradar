# Buienradar
A simple script to retrieve buienradar information from the Belgian [KMI/IRM](https://www.meteo.be/en/brussels "Website"). 

The script will retrieve buienradar images of the last 90 minutes and display them in a GIF animation. This script only works for Belgian forecasting.

The language of the pulled images can be set manually within the script.
